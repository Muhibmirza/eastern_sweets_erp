# eastern_sweets_erp

A complete point-of-sale, inventory, production, accounting, supplier, customer, and workforce management system for sweets shops, bakeries, confectioneries, dessert businesses, and other production-based retail stores.

This repository is currently branded and deployed as **Eastern Sweets**, but the underlying system is not limited to one shop. Business details, products, categories, users, pricing, recipes, suppliers, and operational data can be configured for other businesses.

## What The System Does

The application connects day-to-day shop operations in one system. A sale reduces finished-product stock, production consumes raw materials and updates product cost, supplier activity affects inventory and payables, salary activity connects to employee records, and accounting entries provide a financial view of the business.

### Point Of Sale

- Fast POS billing with quantity, weight, rate, discount, delivery charges, cash received, and change calculation
- Walk-in and customer-linked sales
- Invoice receipts and optional token slips for busy counters
- Sales returns with stock restoration and accounting reversal
- Daily closing and cashier workflows
- Thermal receipt printing through the Windows desktop application

### Sales, Orders, And Customers

- Searchable sales ledger with invoice, token, product, customer, and date filters
- Advance and delivery orders with payment and status tracking
- Customer profiles with order history, POS sales, spending, and outstanding balances
- Product-wise sales reports for selected date ranges

### Inventory And Production

- Finished products and raw-material inventory
- Manual stock adjustments with movement history and backdated entries
- Categories, units, stock alerts, costing, batch details, and expiry information
- Recipe and bill-of-material management
- Production orders with ingredient consumption, overheads, wastage, and actual output
- Production completion adds finished stock and updates the product cost per unit

### Suppliers And Purchasing

- Supplier profiles, purchase history, payments, and chronological ledgers
- Raw-material purchases and stock receiving
- Short-term and long-term supplier advances with recovery tracking
- Purchase returns to suppliers with stock and accounting updates
- Supplier receipts for a selected date range

### Employees And Payroll

- Employee profiles, departments, salary types, and employment status
- Daily attendance, backdated attendance, half days, absences, and approved leave
- Monthly and daily-wage payroll calculation
- Short-term advances, long-term loans, fines, salary revisions, and recoveries
- Salary history, employee ledger, and printable payslips

### Accounting And Reports

- Double-entry journal entries and chart of accounts
- Cash book, general ledger, supplier ledger, and employee ledger
- Trial balance, profit and loss, balance sheet, payroll, stock valuation, and outstanding reports
- Revenue reporting connected to POS sales, delivered orders, and sales returns

### Desktop, Network, Backup, And Updates

- Native Windows desktop application built with Electron
- Local SQLite database stored outside the installed program files
- Access from other computers or mobile devices on the same LAN through the displayed network address
- In-app backup and restore plus a standalone backup utility
- Installer, portable `win-unpacked` build, and `latest.yml` auto-update manifest
- Role-based access for Admin, Production Manager, and Cashier users

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- Windows, macOS, or Linux for web development
- Windows 10/11 x64 for building the desktop installer

### Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run install:all
```

Create `server/.env` with local development values:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL="file:../data/development.db"
JWT_SECRET="replace-with-a-long-random-access-secret"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="replace-with-a-long-random-refresh-secret"
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

Create `client/.env`:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Generate the Prisma client and seed a development database:

```bash
npm run db:generate --prefix server
npm run db:seed --prefix server
```

Start the API and frontend together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- API: `http://localhost:5000/api`

Environment files contain local credentials and configuration and are intentionally excluded from Git. Change seeded passwords before using the system in a real business.

## Production Build

Build the frontend and backend:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build the complete Windows release:

```bat
scripts\build-release.bat
```

The release process produces:

```text
desktop/release/Eastern-Sweets-Setup-<version>.exe
desktop/release/win-unpacked/
desktop/release/latest.yml
```

See [README-DEPLOYMENT.md](README-DEPLOYMENT.md) for installation, LAN access, backup, data-location, and auto-update details.

## Security Notes

- Do not commit `.env` files, database files, backups, or production credentials.
- Replace development JWT secrets and seeded account passwords before deployment.
- Keep regular off-device backups of the application database.
- Restrict Admin access to trusted users.

## Current Deployment

The current packaged build uses the **Eastern Sweets** name, logo, receipt branding, and update endpoint. These are deployment-specific settings; the ERP workflow itself is suitable for other sweets and bakery businesses after configuration and branding changes.


## Security configuration (v1.6.6)

Change admin password on first login.

Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and supply independent random JWT secrets and unique initial user passwords. Generate each JWT secret with `node -e "process.stdout.write(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"`. Initial user passwords must have at least 16 characters and at most 72 UTF-8 bytes. The seed and initial desktop bootstrap hash them with bcryptjs (cost 12); existing users are not reset.

The packaged desktop generates installation-specific JWT secrets and initial passwords in `%APPDATA%/Eastern Sweets/runtime/server/.env` (under Electron's userData directory). The operator can read the initial admin password there on a new installation; it is never printed or bundled. Keep that file private. Updates retain it. Existing passwords remain unchanged; the switch away from shared JWT keys requires signing in again.

Local development reads `server/.env`. The optional legacy Docker setup uses `docker compose --env-file server/.env up -d`; its existing database password was moved without changing an existing volume's credentials. Normal desktop operation uses SQLite and requires no Docker installation.

Production CORS uses `http://localhost:5000` by default, matching the desktop server. A separately hosted web deployment must set CLIENT_URL to its exact trusted origin. Login and refresh share a limit of 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP; the API allows 200 requests per minute per IP. JWT lifetimes are 15 minutes and 30 days. Client environment variables must contain public configuration only.

Run `npm run build --prefix server` then `node scripts/security-smoke.cjs` for the isolated security regression suite. It creates temporary databases under `.tmp`, never the shop database.
